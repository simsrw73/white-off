## Using the Theme

### Install A Browser Plugin

There are a couple of options for installing the theme in your browser.

[![Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/raw/master/images/icon/32.png)](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) Stylus is a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Opera that allows you to override the styling of websites, to change their appearance.

  * [Stylus for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne)
  * [Stylus for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/styl-us/)
  * [Stylus for Opera](https://addons.opera.com/extensions/details/stylus/)


[![Tampermonkey](https://github.com/Tampermonkey/tampermonkey/raw/master/images/icon.png)](http://tampermonkey.net/) Tampermonkey is a browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, and Safari that allows running scripts to change the behavior of websites and add new functionality.

  * [Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
  * [Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
  * [Tampermonkey for Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NBLGGH5162S)
  * [Tampermonkey for Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)
  * [Tampermonkey for Safari](https://safari.tampermonkey.net/tampermonkey.safariextz)

> **Note:**
> Stylish is no longer supported, nor endorsed. What used to be a well known and respected extension was sold and resold and ended up in the hands of an analytics company that captures and transmits your browsing history. Fortunately there are now better options. The Stylish extension and the UserStyles.org website are no longer needed for this theme.


### Install the Theme

Once you've installed one of the extensions above, you are ready to install the theme:

For Stylus users: [![Install with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20with-Stylus-00adad.svg)](https://github.com/simsrw73/white-off/raw/master/release/white-off.user.css)

## Modifying the Theme
